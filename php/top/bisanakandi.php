      <h4>Location</h4>
      <p class="ptext">Bisanakandi is situated at Bangladesh-India border in Sylhet. It is a landscape beauty among gardens and hills. Bichanakandi is a village situated in Rustompur Union under Guainghat Upazilla. This is where many layers of the Khasi mountain meet at a single point from both sides. Flowing from above is a high fall. Adding to its charm are dark clouds hugging the mountain in the rainy season. And flowing underneath towards Bholaganj is a branch of the Piyain. Along the stream flowing from high up in the mountain come huge boulders that are deposited and mined in Bisanakandi.
      Much like Jaflong, Bichnakandi is mostly a quarry. Winter is not a suitable time to visit Bisnakandi due to mechanized mining and stone-laden boats and lorries. The absence of such nuisance makes the rainy season the perfect time to visit the beautiful Bisanakandi that coalesces the charms of high mountains, sinuous rivers, graceful falls and dancing clouds.</p>
